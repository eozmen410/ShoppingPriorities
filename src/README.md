This program is designed to come up with a shopping list, given a budget and the priority of items needed. The items and their priorities are read from a text file, and the budget size is taken as a user input. After the budget is determined, the shopping list is printed to the output file. A priority queue that uses a linked positional list is used in the implementation.
